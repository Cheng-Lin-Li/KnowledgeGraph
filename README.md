# Knowledge Graph
This repository for Web Crawling, Information Extraction, and Knowledge Graph build up.

Implementations of utilities and algorithms to build your knowledge graph by Python 3

I will enrich those implementations and descriptions from time to time. If you include any of my work into your website or project; please add a link to this repository and send me an email to let me know.

Your comments are welcome.
Thanks,

|[JSONLines](https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/KnowledgeGraph/tree/master/CDR_JSONLines)|Once your crawler download a lot of pages, how can you aggregate all of those files into single one? Json Lines is your answer. The program will package each of your file into single JSON object into the file which will contain multiple JSON objects.| [Source Code](https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/KnowledgeGraph/blob/master/CDR_JSONLines/jsonlines.py)|
